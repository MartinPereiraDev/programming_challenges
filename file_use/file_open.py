To open a file in Python, you can use the ` open() ` function, which returns a file
object. The function takes two arguments: the filename and the mode in which to
open the file. 

file = open("example.txt", "r") # opens file for reading

"""

file = open(r"C:\Users\Administrador\workspace\Python\retosProgramacion\file_use\example.txt", "r") # opens file for reading

file.close()
