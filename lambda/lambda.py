In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function that can be defined
without a name. Lambda functions are typically used for short and simple operations
that can be defined inline in the code, without the need to create a separate function.
Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by the function's
arguments and the operation that the function should perform. The syntax for a
lambda function is as follows:
"""
square = lambda x: x**2

print(square)
